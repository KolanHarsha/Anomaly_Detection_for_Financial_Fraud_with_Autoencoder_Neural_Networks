# Anomaly Detection for Financial Fraud with Autoencoder Neural Networks
## **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust fraud detection system for financial transactions using Autoencoder Neural Networks, leveraging data akin to real-time SAP ERP system data. The autoencoder model will be trained to accurately reconstruct regular transaction data, resulting in a low reconstruction loss (below a certain treshold) for these typical patterns. However, when faced with anomalous transactions that deviate from the norm, the model is expected to exhibit a higher reconstruction loss (above a certain treshold), thereby signaling potential fraudulent activity. A key aspect of this project involves visualizing the reconstruction loss across various transactions to clearly distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.
